===Welcome to Compass Agile Enterprise===

Compass Agile Enterprise is a set of Rails Engines that incrementally add the functionality of an ERP and CMS to a Rails application.

It is meant to stay completely out of the directories that a Rails application developer would use, so your app and public directories and clean for you to use.
