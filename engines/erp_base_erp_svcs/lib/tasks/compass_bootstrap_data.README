Compass:Bootstrap:Data README

This rake task orchestrates the several additional tasks in the following sequence

 compass:bootstrap:copy_ignored_data_migrations - copies the data migrations from the 'default plugins'
                                                  data_migrations/ignore dir up to the data_migrations dir
 
 db:migrate_data- executes the data migrations moved by the previous task
 
 compass:bootstrap:delete_data_migrations - deletes the recently moved data migrations
