Description:
    This will create a new grid, appended to crm/relationship_grid.js

Example:
    rails g relationship_grid [class_name/xtype] [relationship_type] [grid_title] [description]

    This will create a file in the public/javascripts/erp_app/organizer/crm/relationship_grid_widgets.js
    If it already exists, it will append a new grid to the end of this file.

    It will also create a new migration for the widget. Run the migration with:
    rake db:generate

    Add the widget to your desired roles via the System Admin in Compass Desktop.  Customize the widget
    as desired; you can use the Relationship controller to adjust the data returned/saved
